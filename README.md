# rBetaBCopula-py
Python implementation of the Beta B copula estimator from Kojadinovic and Yi (2024), "A class of smooth, possibly data-adaptive nonparametric copula estimators containing the empirical beta copula" (Journal of Multivariate Analysis 201: 105269). Originally implemented in R as rBetaBCopula, this repository provides a Python alternative.
